# DystopiOS
This project shows the code for Dystopia's operating system.

DystopiOS is a developing operating system, so please don't expect too much from it.
Commiting is welcome, as DystopiOS is meant to be a orchestra of ideas from people all over the world. However, please only commit if you know what you're doing, as if there are errors, when people download DystopiOS, their computer might stop working.
At the moment, Dystopia doesn't have a tutorial on how to make an operating system, but you can check out Nanobyte's at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t-SPC7Tczc&t=497s.
If you have any ideas but don't know how to add them, message us on the "Discussions" page.
Thank you for everything!
